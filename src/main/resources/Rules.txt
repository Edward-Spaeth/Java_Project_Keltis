Keltis is a multiplayer game meant for 2 -4 people. You have 55 chips divided into five colors: brown, pink, blue, yellow,
green. During the game the players reveal the chips in order to make long color rows.
A player has a decision to make. Either they take a previously revealed chip or they reveal a new one.
If they choose the latter then they have two more options:
 - Either they leave the chip uncovered in the pile. That way their turn has ended.
 - Or they take the chip and put it in the stack that has the same color in it.

The chips in a color row are supposed to be sorted in ascending or descending order. The longer the color rows are,
the more points you get. There are three special items that are displayed on the chip:
The clover: If you picked a chip with a clover next to the number, then you get another move.
Wish stone: For every wish stone you get, you can get minus- or plus points, depending on how many wish stones you have
            at the end
Bonus points: Next to the number of the chip is another number that shows how many bonus points you will get.
              (Not every chip has bonus points!)

Your points will get reducted if your rows are too short and if you don't have enough wish stones.
The player with the most points wins.. The player with the most points wins.
