Keltis is a multiplayer game meant for 2 -4 people. You have 55 chips divided into five colors, pink, blue, yellow, green and brown.
Each color has 11 chips with a number ranging from 0-10 written on it.
 Before the game starts every chip spread out and the numbers written on the chips are hidden.
The player whose turn it is has a decision to make. Either they take a previously revealed chip or they reveal a chip themselves. If they choose the latter then they have two more options:
 - Either they leave the chip uncovered in the pile. That way their turn has ended.
 - Or they take the chip and put it in the stack that has the same color in it.

If the player picked a chip with a high number (e.g. Chip color = blue,  Chip color = 9), then the player needs to pick chips that have a lower number than the one in the previous round.
The same procedure happens if the player picked a chip with a low number (e.g. 0). Every chip after that needs to be a higher number.

Example: After the player picked a chip with the number 9 from the pile, they can add chips ranging from 0-8 from the pile. The only condition is the number has to be smaller than the previous one. If they picked a chip with the number 7  and put it in the stack after 9, and proceed to get a chip 8 in the next round , then they must leave it in the pile, because 8 is bigger than 7.

There are three special items that are displayed on the cip:
The clover: If you picked a chip with a clover next to the number, then you get another move.
Wish stone: For every wish stone you get, you can get minus- or plus points, depending on how many wish stones you have at the end
Bonus points: Next to the number of the chip is another number that shows how many bonus points you will get. (Not every chip has bonus points!)

At the end of the game you will count how many points you have for each stack + the bonus points + wish stones and add them up. The player with the most points wins.
